run-help-aur is a Zsh run-help assistant. It allows run-help to open the correct man page for the aur commands, instead of opening aur(1).
To use it, first setup run-help following zshcontrib(1), then place run-help-aur in fpath and autoload it.
For example, after installing run-help-aur to /usr/share/zsh/functions/Misc/run-help-aur and autoloading run-help, run:

autoload -Uz run-help-aur

Refer to zshcontrib(1) for more details on run-help and its assistant functions.
