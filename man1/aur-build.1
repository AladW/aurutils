.SH NAME
aur\-build \- build packages to a local repository

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY "aur build"
.OP "\-d" database
.OP \-cfNRsv
.OP \-a queue
.OP \--

.SH DESCRIPTION
Build packages adding the results to a local repository, or a
.BR pacman (8)
repository configured with a
.I file://
prefix in
.BR pacman.conf (5).

.SH OPTIONS
All arguments after \-\- are passed to
.BR makepkg (8),
or
.BR makechrootpkg
when
.B \-c
is specified.

.TP
.BI \-a " FILE" "\fR,\fP \-\-arg\-file=" FILE
A text file describing directories that contain a PKGBUILD, relative to
the current directory. If unspecified, the current directory is assumed.

.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-chroot
Build packages inside a
.BR systemd\-nspawn (1)
container with
.BR makechrootpkg .
See
.BR aur\-chroot (1)
for more information.

.TP
.BI \-d " NAME" "\fR,\fP \-\-database=" NAME
The name of the pacman database.

.TP
.BI \-D " DIR" "\fR,\fP \-\-directory=" DIR
The path pointing to the container.

.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-force
Continue the build process if a package with the same name is found
(ignoring the extension). Existing packages will be moved with a
.I ~
suffix.

.TP
.BI \-\-makepkg\-conf= FILE
.BR makepkg.conf (5)
used inside the container.

.TP
.BR \-N ", " \-\-no-sync
Do not sync the local repository after building.

.TP
.BI \-\-pacman\-conf= FILE
.BR pacman.conf (5)
used inside the container.

.TP
.BI \-r " DIR" "\fR,\fP \-\-root=" DIR
The root directory for the repository. The
.I root
is the location for the pacman database
.RI ( foo.db ),
built packages, and secondary files such as the files database
.RI ( foo.files ).
This defaults to the value of the
.B Server
directive for the configured repository.

.SY Note:
The
.I Server
directive configured in
.BR pacman.conf (5)
is used for
.BR pacman (8)
sync operations regardless of this setting. See also
.BR \-N .

.TP
.B \-R
Remove old package files from disk when updating their entry in the
database
.RB ( "repo\-add \-R" ).

.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-sign
Sign built packages and the database
.RB ( "repo\-add \-s" )
with
.BR gpg (1).
To use another key than the default, the
.B GPGKEY
environment variable can be set to the appopriate key identifier.

.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verify
Verify the PGP signature of the database before
updating.
.RB ( "repo\-add \-v" ).

selected with
.BR aur\-repo (1).

.SH NOTES
.SS Repository updates
When building locally (outside a container),
.B "pacman \-Syu"
is run while restricted to a local repository. This is comparable to
.BR "makepkg \-i" ,
but without subsequent package installation (if a package was
installed before, it is updated to the latest available version). An
interesting side-effect is that pacman considers packages inside the
official repositories "local", and warns if they are newer than any
custom counterpart. Packages which define a
.I replaces
field are ignored if the target package is installed on the local system.

Databases are built with
.B LANG=C
to avoid libalpm from skipping entries if the locale is not set
(FS#49342). Packages are signed manually with
.B "gpg \-\-batch \-\-detach\-sign \-\-no\-armor"
(FS#49946).

.SS Using a dedicated build user
While using a dedicated user for the build process does not increase
security (beyond protecting against packaging errors that write to
.IR $HOME ),
it may be useful when the local repository will be accessible to
multiple users or as a way to avoid password prompts. (Note that such
a user must be unprivileged; as of pacman 4.2,
.BR makepkg (8)
may not run directly as root.)

New users may be created with
.BR useradd (8)
as follows:
.EX

  # useradd build --system --shell /sbin/nologin --home-dir /var/cache/build --create-home

.EE

Because dependency resolution is not replicated and left to
.BR makepkg (8)
(see
.B handle_deps()
in
.BR /usr/bin/makepkg )
the
.I build
user should be allowed to run
.BR pacman (8)
with elevated privileges. For example, create the
.I /etc/sudoers.d/10_build
file with following contents:
.EX

  build ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pacman

.EE
.BR aur-build (1)
(and related programs such as
.BR aur-sync (1))
may now be run as the new
.I build
user. For example:
.EX

  # cd /var/cache/build
  # sudo -u build git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mypackage.git
  # cd mypackage
  # sudo -u build aur build -d custom

.EE
Any created files in the local repository (such as packages,
signatures and database files) will be owned by the
.I build
user.

.SS PKGBUILD signatures
GPG signatures defined in the
.B validpgpkeys
array may be automatically retrieved by setting
.I "keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve"
in
.BR gpg.conf .
See
.BR gpg (1)
for details.
